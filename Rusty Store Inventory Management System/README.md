# Rusty Store Inventory Management System

## Overview

This project is an inventory management system developed in Rust for a small retail store. It allows store managers to add, edit, and delete products from the inventory, as well as generate reports on the current inventory.

## Features

- **Inventory Management**: Store managers can add, edit, and delete products from the inventory. Each product includes a name, description, price, and quantity.
- **Reporting**: The system can generate user-friendly reports that display the store's inventory in a structured format.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling is implemented to handle invalid inputs and other possible errors gracefully.
- **Security**: Basic security measures, such as authentication for store managers, are in place to prevent unauthorized access to the inventory.
- **Text-Based User Interface**: The system features a clear and intuitive text-based user interface that allows store managers to easily navigate and perform tasks.
